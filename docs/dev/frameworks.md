Dnnamo standardizes the interface to neural networks by wrapping them in model objects, but most of the heavy lifting internally is done using *frameworks*.
Frameworks provide a set of tools for interacting with models that leverage the underlying machine learning framework which the model is implemented in (hence the name).
